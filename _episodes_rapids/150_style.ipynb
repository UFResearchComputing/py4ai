    "Coding style helps us to understand the code better. It helps to maintain and change the code. Python relies strongly on coding style, as we may notice by the indentation we apply to lines to define different blocks of code. Python proposes a standard style through one of its first Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP), [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008), and highlight the importance of readability in the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020).\n",

The [PEP8 application and Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) can check your code for compliance with PEP8.\n",
