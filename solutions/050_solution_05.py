# Since you just wrote the code and are familiar with it, you might actually 
# find the first version easier to read. But when trying to read a huge piece 
# of code written by someone else, or when getting back to your huge piece of 
# code after several months, non-abbreviated names are often easier except 
# when there are clear abbreviation conventions.
