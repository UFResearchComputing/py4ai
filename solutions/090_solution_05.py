# The program prints:
#
# `furn`
# 
# `eniroulf`
#
# 1. `stride` is the step size of the slice
# 2. The slice `1::2` selects all even-numbered items from a collection: it starts
#    with element `1` (which is the second element, since indexing starts at `0`),
#    goes on until the end (since no `end` is given), and uses a step size of `2`
#    (i.e., selects every second element).
