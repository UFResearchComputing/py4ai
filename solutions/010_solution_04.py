# The notebook shows the equation as it would be rendered from LaTeX equation 
# syntax. The dollar sign, $, is used to tell Markdown that the text in between is 
# a LaTeX equation. If you’re not familiar with LaTeX, underscore, _, is used for 
# subscripts and circumflex, ^, is used for superscripts. A pair of curly braces, 
# { and }, is used to group text together so that the statement i=1 becomes the 
# the subscript and N becomes the superscript. Similarly, -i is in curly braces 
# to make the whole statement the superscript for 2. \sum and \approx are LaTeX 
# commands for “sum over” and “approximate” symbols.
